## Discription
The purpose of this project was to apply my understanding of React to build a personal porfolio application. This application also furthers my professional goals by being a space where I can showcase myself, and the web development projects that Ive created, through out my time as a web developer. It serves as a project that is relevant through all skill levels, and as such, will grow in uniqueness and purpose as my programming skills grow.
